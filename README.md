## vue-directive-outside-click
A Vue custom directive to close elements when clicking outside of the element.

# Please Note

This is a test module for me to try and figure out publishing vue directives to NPM.

It is functional but the vast majority of the code used is taken from both the excellent article and the existing module by [Taha Shashtari](https://github.com/TahaSh)

Please read the original artice here: [An Easy Way to Detect Clicks Outside an Element in Vue](https://tahazsh.com/detect-outside-click-in-vue)

Please use the original module here: [A simple vue directive to detect outside clicks](https://github.com/TahaSh/vue-closable)

Both the article and the module are both really well documented and the code commented...unlike mine here, which will probably break!
